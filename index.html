      <div class="section-type-1-text" id="section1Text">At it’s core, advertising is telling other humans about something you're selling. Currently the telling is done through many primitive mediums, billboards, product placements, endorsements, videos, and mail to name a few.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-type-2" id="section2">
      <img class="section-type-2-image" id="section2Image" src="./images/2.png"></img>
      <div class="section-type-2-text" id="section2Text">Most of the time when humans are exposed to advertising, it's passive and static. Interaction is little-to-none. The effort put into spreading these words of persuasion are for naught as they are perceived as annoying, like swarms of flies being directed at the faces of consumers.</div>
    </div>
    <div class="section-type-3" id="section3">
      <img class="section-type-3-image" id="section3Image" src="./images/3.png"></img>
      <div class="section-type-3-text" id="section3Text">Technology will advance, consumer behaviour and habits will shift, current marketing strategies will grow old, and new ones must be devised to continue capturing the attention of the public. The relationship between humans and their surrounding location will be a critical factor to utilize when integrating interactive elements into advertising.</div>

    <div class="section-type-4" id="section4">
      <div class="section-type-4-text" id="section4Text">To create an interesting experience for consumers with the existing urban landscape, virtual augmented reality scavenger hunts could be set up in cities and shopping centres to “gamify” these marketing experiences and award them with free samples, discounts, or deals for completion.</div>

      <img class="section-type-2-image" id="section5Image" src="./images/5.png"></img>
      <div class="section-type-2-text" id="section5Text">Holograms and holographic technology has the potential to place objects in the real world without the need of equipment or initiation from the user, drawing in their attention effortlessly. Imagine a holographic projector in front of a hat store that puts hats onto nearby heads as they walk by, displaying their products in use instantly.</div>

    <div class="section-type-5" id="section6">
      <div class="section-type-5-text" id="section6Text">The devices used to experience augmented reality will eventually be as portable and seamless as a pair of glasses or contact lenses. The lines between reality and the digital space will be blurred to the point where the world will be a canvas for advertisers and artists to promote themselves to anyone, everywhere, anytime. Physical objects could be swapped for experiences tailored for different people depending on their personality, preferences, and position.</div>

      <div class="section-type-6-text" id="section7Text">As the population grows, it will become unfeasible for humans to walk around in urban areas dense with obstructions. Delivering these virtual, interactive, experiences to the home will be the next objective for marketers and developers. The convergence of artificial intelligence, big data, augmented reality, virtual reality, and smart home technology create pleasing and adaptive adventures that will make consumers welcome advertisements as a part of their homes and lives.

        Imagine waking up to a virtual AI-based mirror that suggests clothing and adapts to the user’s fashion preferences and where they intend to go that day.</div>
